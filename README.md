# Film-search-engine

#### hi, welcome to my search engine and here's a little explanation as to why I have created this little program.

###### I found that when looking for a film, I often couldn't find what I was looking for without being bombarded with pop up ads and dodgy websites, so U decided to do something about it.

###### I went out and created a program that surfs through 12 vetted websites and looks for a film of your choice. It then outputs whether your film was found on each website, and gives you the option to select your website of choice. It then outputs a link to the film and a link to the website.

###### its a bunch of spaghetti code, and I hope to add a GUI in the future but for now it does the job and I'm currently procrastinating revision for my mocks so its not like I have time anyway.

###### hopefully you enjoy this little side project and if you have any websites you want me to add, feel free to make a pr and I'll get to adding it ASAP.
