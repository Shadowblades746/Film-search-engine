# Film-search-engine

#### hi, welcome to my search engine and here's a little explanation as to why I have created this little program.

###### I found that when looking for a film, I often couldn't find what I was looking for without being bombarded by pop up ads and dodgy websites, so I decided to do something about it.

###### I went out and created a program that surfs through 12 vetted websites and looks for a film of your choice. It then outputs whether your film was found on each website, and gives you the option to select your website of choice. It then outputs, and copies to your clipboard, a link to the film and a link to the website.

###### The way to use this program, is by downloading the zip folder and running the executable

###### its a bunch of spaghetti code, and I hope to add a GUI in the future but for now it does the job and I'm currently procrastinating revision for my mocks so its not like I have time anyway.

###### hopefully you enjoy this little side project and if you have any websites you want me to add, feel free to make a pr and I'll get to adding it ASAP.

###### Edit: 4 months later, im looking back at this and the executable seems to still work despite the many errors which you may find. a few websites no longer work, im aware of this, but this is meant to be a proof of concpet, and i intend to develop this further in a less intrusive and more intuitive way in the future. make sure to tell me any safe websites, and i'll be sure to spend the 15 or 20 mins it takes to set up the code to add it to the list
